Antidos is a small program to fend off DoS attacks. Normally closed, for example, a browser, the connections when the server is not responding. Flood programs, however, constantly open new connections, so that can be filtered out with the corresponding parameters. Antidos blocked the IPs of the attackers permanent with iptables, so that you can use cron to unlocked the IPs.

Antidos dumps all tcp-connections on an attack to /root/%date%.txt for later analysis.

With this small program we have successfully defeated attacks to a little vserver with 256MB ram by more than 9000 attackers.

Antidos is written to use with daemontools[1] and needed to compile the libowfat[2].
